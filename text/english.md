# Whitewater kayaking at Voss

## Welcome to Voss!

Voss is no doubt one of the most exciting whitewater regions in Norway. This booklet contains information about various rivers and playspots and should help you get the best kayaking experience in this area. Voss has a great variety of rivers starting high in the mountains, roaming through deep gorges and ending up meandering mellowly into the fiords. Be also prepared for untouched nature, crystal clear and ice cold water.

Voss kajakklubb is the local kayaking club that organizes the competitions in the Extreme sports week every summer and works to protect the rivers and creeks against hydroelectric power plans. See the club’s web pages for updated versions of these river guides and find more information about the area.

Please note that the Gyrodactilus salaris parasite is not found here. Remember to desinfect your boat and paddling gear before putting on our clean rivers!

Welcome to Voss and see you on the river!

## Kleivelvi

This is a serious section with high waterfalls, serious slides and sticky holes. There have been accidents in these rapids, so remember to set up safety. 

Park at the Mjølfjell hostel and hike up to the put-in at the lake. The first part to the confluence is easy warm-up, after this there are 4-5 major rapids packed into a short section of the river. All rapids are easy to scout.

## Mjølfjell

This is a long trip in beautiful surroundings. The river is alternating between sections of continuous but easy rapids and steep drops (class V) that requires scouting and perhaps portage.

The put-in is at the Mjølfjell hostel, and the take-out is 11km below at the “Nosebreaker” waterfall. You can also take out where the railway crosses the road.

At the end of the section you paddle past a good playhole. This is a good spot for playboating at high flows. The “Nosebreaker” waterfall is the last challenge on the section. This is 12m high and has a tricky entrance line. Protect your nose if you want to paddle this drop!

## Reimegrend

Reimegrend is more challenging than the “Skytebanen” and Urdland-Meringi sections. Everything can be paddled except a few big waterfalls towards the end of the trip. Large portions of this trip is in a narrow and deep gorge, so hiking out is not easy. 

Put in at the train station at Reimegrend and take out where the river runs next to the road halfway between Urdland and Skiple.

The first rapids give an indication on the difficulties, and here you have large pools to recover. The most serious section is in the middle of the gorge. A long continuous rapid is succeeded by a big hole covering most of the river. 

Towards the end there are some big drops that can be paddled on the right flows, or easily portaged on the right side. After the portages a few more fun rapids and a technical gorge follow.

## Skytebanen

The section from Skiple to Urdland is called “Skytebanen” (named after the shooting range nearby). This is a very popular paddling section that is fun on all water levels. 

Put in at the bridge that crosses the river at the exit of the “Skyttargrava” gorge. Alternatively you can hike to “Turbo-Lars”, and get a few more challenging rapids. Remember to close the gate and pay the road toll! Take out at the next road bridge.

If you want more challenges, you can continue 1km downstream, through the exciting “Tømmerholo”/”Morning Glory” and the church drop “Kyrkje­droppet”.

## Urdland

This section is easier than “Skytebanen” and contains more waves and holes. It is popular to use a playboat here. Start at the gauge below Bøfossen and take out at the bridge at Meringi. Park your car up at the main road as this is a private road.

The first kilometer contains some technical rapids that shows the typical difficulty of the river. There are also several calm sections here. Then the river enters a gorge where  getting out of the river gets difficult. Scouting and portaging is not a problem.

The last 5-600m before the confluence with Urdlandselvi the action picks up, and if you are lucky there is a good play wave here. “Hesteskodroppet” (the horse shoe drop) is a 3m ledge and “Mathilda” is a big sticky hole that follows. It is easy to portage on the right side.

After Meringi the river enters Rastalii, a steep gorge with obligatory portages that can only be paddled on very low flows.

## Rastalii

This is a run going through a spectacular gorge with several hundred meter high walls on the sides. The rapids are shaped by big boulders and are of varying levels of difficulty. The main gorge starts with two serious rapids and is followed by an
obligatory portage that requires a rappel. 

After the gorge there is a magnificent twin waterfall that can be paddled. The last km is flat and you can take out at the Selheim bridge or continue downstream through the next section “Marinejuvet”.

This serious run should only be attempted on very low flows (below 13m³/s).

## Marinejuvet

This run got its name from a raft accident where British Royal marines paddled this section of the river by mistake. If you are well prepared and select a day with the right water level, this is anyway a great run in a beautiful gorge.

Start at the bridge to Selheim, or hike to the big waterfall at the end of the Rastalii section.

Take out at the military camp in Bømoen.

This run is blocked by large boulders and is shallow on low flows. On higher flows the lines are cleaner but more hectic.

There are two gorges. The first gorge below Selheim is the most serious, this is very narrow and inaccessible. The first two rapids are impossible to scout. At the end of the gorge there is a waterfall. The second gorge starts with a waterfall.

## Bjørke - Palmafossen

This is a great beginner run in one of the slower running sections of Raundalselvi. Put in below the shooting range at Bjørke, and take out before the dam at Palmafossen. The only rapid to mention on this section is a small ledge approximately halfway down the run. On high water this can be a hole.

After Palmafossen the river runs through the narrow gorge Brynagjelet (only for experienced kayakers). The last section from Tvildemoen to the lake is great for beginners.

## Skjelviki

The section from Skjelviki to Taulen camping is a great run for beginners, with short rapids and big eddies. This part of Strandaelvi is well suited for learning the sport.

Put in at the red garage in Skjelviki. Be careful not to obstruct the garage entrance when parking.

At the end of the run you can find “Busstoppen”, the bus stop hole, a great playspot with a large eddy. This is very popular for training freestyle moves. 25-30m³/s in Myrkdalselvi is perfect flow for the play spot.

Take out at the bus stop just before the bridge to Taulen camping. Following downstream is the Åsbrekk gorge (class V) with the renowned “Money-drop” waterfall.

## Nedre del

The lower section of Strandaelvi is a local favourite, due to short driving distance and exciting rapids well suited for technique training.

The river alternates between short technical rapids and long calm stretches. This section can be run on all water levels.

Park at the large information board below the bridge at Åsbrekkgjelet. Start with “Kvernhusfossen” (the mill waterfall). If you are ready for more adrenaline, put in at “Money-drop”.

Take out at the sawmill below Tvinne.

The first 200m below Villmarksleiren are the most challenging rapids on this run. All rapids are easy to scout.

## Holaelvi

Right above Skjelviki, the beginner section of Strandaelvi, Holaelvi flows into the main river in a gentle manner. It is a true local classic, loved for its powerful boofs down a narrow canyon, 20 minutes from Voss.

Put in at Rødno where Holaelvi and Løkjaelvi flows together. Park at the farm Rødno at the road that goes up on river right. Remember to knock on the door and pay the parking fee to this kind family. From the put-in, float down 200 meters of shallow water before the fun begins. Take out is on river right just at the E16 bridge. Here you will find a gauge where II is considered to be as smooth as Turkish Delight, but where various people find their joy and guilty pleasures anywhere between I and III. Portages are not needed, but scouting is mandatory several places down this tight canyon.

If time and lust is on your side, you can continue down Strandaelvi and test your character on the infamous “Well of Sacrifice” and the famous “Money Drop” before it eases off. If you want a real adventure, head up to Lund and check the monster slides in the upper parts of Holaelvi.

## Øvre Myrkdalselvi

The upper part of Myrkdalselvi is an easy accessible run in beautiful mountain landscape. Running this part of the river is a good alternative when the level is too high for the lower section. 

Put in 600m above the bridge that crosses the river and take out before the bridge at Årmot.

This run contains 5-6 bigger rapids, all of them are easy to scout. Beware of the drop just after the put-in, at high flow this ends in a sticky hole with an undercut on the left side.

There is a high waterfall 500m before the bridge at Årmot that is recommended to portage.

## Nedre Myrkdalselvi

This is one of the most famous river sections around Voss, filled with high drops and long slides. The lower section of Myrkdalselvi is a challenging run, especially at flows above 20m³/s.

The river runs on bedrock in a small gorge, and this section contains between 15-20 major rapids. It is possible to portage all rapids, but dense vegetation and steep slopes on the sides makes it difficult. The triple slides, “Karma Cow falls”, is the highlight of the run and is found 2km after the put-in. A mad cow was once observed swimming the first of these slides.

In the second half of the run there is a high waterfall that must be portaged on the right side.

## Brandsetelvi

This river is the jewel in the Voss river system. The crystal clear water and steep and technical rapids attracts visitors from all over the world. 
To get to the put-in for the upper section, drive to the closed gate and hike about 1km to the river. You can also put in above the small foot-bridge further downstream, when you want to get right into the big slides. There is one obvious portage following shortly after the initial drops. Scouting and portaging is easy.
The lower part contains the competition section for the downhill race of the Extreme sports week. This section is short and steep, but easier than the big slides upstream.

## Brekkedalselvi

Brekkedalselvi is a beautiful river high up in the mountains, with interesting rapids and a sweet 12m drop at the end.

Put in on the flat section below Ringheimsøyni.

The river enters a gorge with several small drops and a long slide. Scouting and portage is easy.  The next 2km is easy, but after the road crosses the river the gradient increases again and the difficulty picks up. Below the portage at Vetlestølen you find the big waterfall. Make sure to take out before the river leaps off the cliff below Sivle.

## Øvre Jordalselvi

It is a long drive to upper Jordalselvi, but this river is absolutely worth the drive. The road normally is not opened before June.

Put in at the lakes above Nedstestølen, a section of short and exciting rapids follows. There is a long flat section in the middle, this can be avoided if you put in at Kåstein. The most interesting rapids are towards the end of the run. Note that it is possible to be pulled behind the curtain of the last waterfall.

This river requires high water levels, the season is normally during snowmelt in June and after heavy rain. If the water level is too high, Berdalselvi may be a good alternative.

## Nedre Jordalselvi

The lower section of Jordalselvi contains a long class III section, but also a section of serious rapids towards the end. The put-in is above or below the Jordalsfossen waterfall. The next 2km is easy. When the river turns sharp right the difficulty increases. Note that you should scout as soon as you get into the gorge, as it is impossible to stop as soon as you have started paddling here. The last part  is filled with big holes, slides and drops.

Take out before the tunnel, the section that follows is not suited for kayaking.

Below the tunnels there is 1km steep whitewater that can be paddled.

## Rjoåni

Rjoåni is most known for the tunnel slide and the drop “Tyskardroppet” featured in many kayaking movies.

Drive to Mjølfjell train station. The road is closed just above the railway and you have to carry your boat as far as you want to paddle.

All rapids are easy to scout from the road. Under the railroad the river runs through a tunnel with sharp rocks. Below follows the waterfall Rjoandefossen and a big slide.

## Bordalselvi

The upper part of Bordalselvi is a section that requires high water levels.

To reach the put-in, drive to Rong and continue on the gravel road marked with a sign to Ålvik. Put in under the bridge. Take-out is at the bridge near Jerald.

The first part of the run is easy warm-up. Then the difficulty increases gradually. On higher flows some scouting is recommended, on low flows everything can be scouted from the eddies. 

There are more interesting rapids following downstream to Tesdal, but also some portages.

## Sagelvi

Sagelvi is a small creek with not too difficult rapids.  Every rapid is easy to scout and easy to portage if neccessary. This river needs heavy rain to get to the right level.

The normal put-in is at Svangastølen, and the take-out is at the road bridge 2.5km downstream. There is one obstructed waterfall that should be portaged near Hagen.

## Tverrelvi

Tverrelvi is short but beautiful creek with a tiny season. You need snow melt or serious rain for the water level to be right here.
The put-in is just above the confluence with Kvitlaelvi and the take-out is below the farmhouse at Steine.

## Storelvi

This is the best beginner section around Voss when the water level is high. The upper section of the Granvin river is idyllic with gentle rapids and big eddies.

Put in at the first road below the Skjervsfossen waterfall. Take out at the last bridge before the river enters the Granvin lake.

Just before the confluence with Skorvo there is a small ledge. If you don’t like this rapid, it is easy to portage on the right side.

## Øvre Teigdalselvi

Teigdalselvi is a famous river, most known for the hair-raising “Double drop”. This river also offers a steep gradient and many serious waterfalls and slides.

Drive through a tunnel after the steep hills above Brekkhus to get to the put-in. 

The first part of the river is characteristic for the river. It contains waterfalls, slides and runs through a gorge. The last point of return is the drop where a stream enters the river from the right side. A waterfall follows and then a portage on the left side is recommended. Then there is a technical section and the big “Notter” drop. The river continues with a long flat part before the river enters another gorge with a drop in the entrance. Finally you arrive at the main attraction, the double drop. Take out after this waterfall.

Teigdalselvi is unfortunately a diverted river, and needs a steady supply of rain to get to the right water level. Snow melt or lots of rain is neccessary to run this river.

## Nedre Teigdalselvi

The lower Teigdalselvi is a great paddling section of intermediate difficulty. This part of the river needs lots of rain to be runnable, like the upper section.

Put in below the lowest bridge or as far up as you want. The river increases in difficulty upstream. Take out when you see the lake.

## Urdlandselvi

Urdlandselvi is one of the steepest rivers in Voss, and this run is one of the most difficult you can find around here. The water level should be high to paddle this river. 

Put in where the road crosses the river or a bit further upstream if you want another drop. Several rapids should be scouted and halfway down there is a big waterfall.
Take out at the main road or continue down to Meringi.

## Milky wave

Milky wave is the biggest wave around Voss. This wave only appears when Raundalselvi runs very high, most likely in the snow melt season or after heavy rain in the autumn.

There are large eddies on both sides of the wave, but you have to start on the left side to enter the wave. At extremely high water levels it can be difficult to get back to the left eddy if you end up on the right side.

The best flow is above 180m³/s, but the spot can be used down to 150m³/s, then it is more of a hole with a small should on surfer’s right.

Park at “Magasinet” in Tvildemoen and paddle 200m upstream to get to the wave.

## Bulken - Evanger

The section from Geitle to Evanger is a great beginner run with big waves only.

The Bulken surf wave needs 120-150m³/s.

At Flaga a sweet hole/wave appears when the flow is above 90m³/s. Be careful with the big drop just downstream.

The Blå brua (blue bridge) hole is great for looping at flows around 20-35m³/s.

The Evanger wave is a fun and safe playspot between 160-220m³/s.
